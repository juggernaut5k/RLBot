# In order to run this successfully:
# 1. Run 'pip install py4j'  (one time setup)
# 2. Modify runner.py to use this agent, e.g. "import JavaAgent as agent2"
# 3. Choose a port number, and put it both in this class and in AgentEntryPoint.java
#    - Avoid 25333 because that's the default, and other bots may be using it!
#    - See the myPort variable below, which I've set to -1 so that you're forced to see this.
# 4. Run the AgentEntryPoint class, and leave it running
# 5. Run runner.py

Hi! You can use this code as a template to create your own bot.  Also if you don't mind writing a blurb
about your bot's strategy you can put it as a comment here. I'd appreciate it, especially if I can help
debug any runtime issues that occur with your bot.
